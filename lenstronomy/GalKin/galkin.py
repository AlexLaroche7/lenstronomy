    """
    Major class to compute velocity dispersion measurements given light and mass models

    The class supports any mass and light distribution (and superposition thereof) that has a 3d correspondance in their
    2d lens model distribution. For models that do not have this correspondance, you may want to apply a
    Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) on their models and use the MGE to be de-projected to 3d.

    The computation follows Mamon&Lokas 2005 and performs the spectral rendering of the seeing convolved apperture with
    the method introduced by Birrer et al. 2016.

    The class supports various types of anisotropy models (see Anisotropy class) and aperture types (see Aperture class).
    Solving the Jeans Equation requires a numerical integral over the 3d light and mass profile (see Mamon&Lokas 2005).
    This class (as well as the dedicated LightModel and MassModel classes) perform those integral numerically with an
    interpolated grid.

    The seeing convolved integral over the aperture is computed by rendering spectra (light weighted LOS kinematics)
    from the light distribution.

    The cosmology assumed to compute the physical mass and distances are set via the kwargs_cosmo keyword arguments.
        d_d: Angular diameter distance to the deflector (in Mpc)
        d_s: Angular diameter distance to the source (in Mpc)
        d_ds: Angular diameter distance from the deflector to the source (in Mpc)

    The numerical options can be chosen through the kwargs_numerics keywords
        sampling_number: number of spectral rendering to compute the light weighted integrated LOS dispersion within
        the aperture. This keyword should be chosen high enough to result in converged results within the tolerance.

        interpol_grid_num: number of interpolation points in the light and mass profile (radially). This number should
        be chosen high enough to accurately describe the true light profile underneath.
        log_integration: bool, if True, performs the interpolation and numerical integration in log-scale.

        max_integrate: maximum 3d radius to where the numerical integration of the Jeans Equation solver is made.
        This value should be large enough to contain most of the light and to lead to a converged result.
        min_integrate: minimal integration value. This value should be very close to zero but some mass and light
        profiles are diverging and a numerically stabel value should be chosen.

    These numerical options should be chosen to allow for a converged result (within your tolerance) but not too
    conservative to impact too much the computational cost. Reasonable values might depend on the specific problem.
